# Goomba Render + Engine
This is a work in progress repo. The engine doesn't function at this point.
Right now this is loosely based on TheCherno's game engine and opengl series. I will also be using [this renderer](https://github.com/htmlboss/OpenGL-Renderer) for some reference.

## Dependencies
I don't think there are any right now, besides CMake and C++ stuff.
I'm not sure if it will compile on all platforms right now, but I will try and make that work ASAP

## Notice
I believe that all licenses have been included and are compatible but I might be missing something, so let me know. This repository will be licensed ASAP.
