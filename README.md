# Goomba Render + Engine Phase 1 (Extreme WIP)
This is a work in progress repo. The engine doesn't function at this point.
Read [here](mgmt/details.md) for details about the planned features and development plan.

## Dependencies for build
I don't think there are any right now, besides CMake and C++ stuff.
I'm not sure if it will compile on all platforms right now, but I will try and make that work ASAP

## Libraries

## Documentation

## Notice
I believe that all licenses have been included and are compatible but I might be missing something, so let me know. This repository will be licensed ASAP.
