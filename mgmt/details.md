# The Plan
## Phase 1:
- Setup
- Basic application, window
- No real event or input system
- Hardcoded ImGUI
- OpenGL abstractions
- Hardcoded render pipeline
- Model loading
- Material system
- Code based scene system
- Forward rendering lighting

## Phase 2:
- Event and input system
- Layer system
- Deferred rendering
- Shadow mapping
- Blending

## Phase 3:
- Resource importing
- Data based scenes
- PBR
- Clustered forward rendering

## Phase ?:
- More rendering techniques
- Data based rendering pipeline?
